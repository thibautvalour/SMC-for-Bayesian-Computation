# SMC-for-Bayesian-Computation

This repository contains a python implementation of the method described in the article [An adaptive sequential Monte Carlo method for approximate Bayesian computation] by Del Moral, Doucet, and Jasra. The method is a variation of the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm, which is a Monte Carlo method used to estimate posterior distributions in Bayesian inference.

The final report, which presents a summary of the research paper and the results of our reimplementation, is available by clicking on "report.pdf".

To run the code, you can run the main.py file directly, in an environment with numpy and scipy.
