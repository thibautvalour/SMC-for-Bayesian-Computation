# SMC-for-Bayesian-Computation

This repository contains a python implementation of the method described in the article [An adaptive sequential Monte Carlo method for approximate Bayesian computation] by Del Moral, Doucet, and Jasra. The method is a variation of the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm, which is a Monte Carlo method used to estimate posterior distributions in Bayesian inference.
